<p> NSS, is a voluntary association of young people in Colleges, Universities and at +2 level working for a campus-community linkage. The cardinal principle of the NSS programme is that it is organised by the students themselves, and both students and teachers through their combined participation in community service, get a sense of involvement in the tasks of nation building.</p>
<h2 style="color:#0000ff;">Objectives of our team:</h2
<ul>
  <li>To identify the needs and problems in the community in the solution of which they can be involved.</li>
  <li>To enable the students to understand the community in which they work.</li>
  <li>To acquire leadership qualities and democratic attitude.</li>
  <li>To develop capacity to meet emergencies and national disasters and
practice national integration</li>
<li>Gain skills in mobilising community participation.</li>
<li>Underlines that the welfare of an individual is ultimately dependent on the welfare of society on the whole.</li>
</ul> 
<h2  align="center" style="color:#0000ff;">NSS Day</h2>
